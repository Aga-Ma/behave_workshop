  + Benefits of BDD
  + Python BDD test frameworks
* Behave Test Framework
  + Gherkin mechanics  
    - Example feature  
    - The background selection
    - A scenario outline
  + Python comes into play
    - Step definitions

## Goals

After the training:
* You will know the BDD concept and its advantages
* You will know how to work with `behave` framework  
* You will be able to create tests based on gained knowledge  

# Behavior Driven Development
## What is behave?
In software it describes how the software operates

### It answers WHAT more than HOW
Behavior are defined early in development using specification by example: plain-language descriptions (Gherkin) that tell what more than how
Behavior specs becomes requirements, ACC and acceptance tests (all in one)

## What is BDD?
BDD is a second-generation, outsideâ€“in, pull-based, multiple-stakeholder, multiple-scale, high-automation, agile methodology. It describes a cycle of interactions with well-defined outputs, resulting in the delivery of working, tested software that matters.  

## Benefits of BDD

# Behave Test Framework
## Installation check

Pre-training preparation - [behave_workshop/installation.md](../installation.md)

## Gherkin mechanics
### Given, When, Then (And, But)

<span style="color: blue;">Scenario</span>: Refunded items should be returned to stock  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">**Given**</span> a customer previously bought a black sweater from me  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">and</span> I currently have three black sweaters left in stock.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">**When**</span> he returns the sweater for a refund  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">**Then**</span> I should have four black sweaters in stock.,  
  
<span style="color: blue;">Scenario</span>: Replaced items should be returned to stock  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">**Given**</span> that a customer buys a blue garment  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">and</span> I have two blue garments in stock  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">and</span> three black garments in stock.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">**When**</span> he returns the garment for a replacement in black,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">**Then**</span> I should have three blue garments in stock  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">and</span> two black garments in stock.  

<span style="color: red;">**Feature**</span>: feature name  

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: blue;">**Scenario**</span>: some scenario  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">**Given**</span> some condition  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">**Then**</span> some result is expected.  

### A scenario outline
### TO DO (Example)

## Python comes into play

Step definitions (Gluing step to definitions (decorators))

+--features/  
|   +--steps/       # -- Steps directory  
|   |    +-- *.py   # -- Step implementation or use step-library python files.  
|   +-- *.feature   # -- Feature files written by your Business Analyst / Sponsor / whoever   
                    # with your behaviour scenarios in it  
                    
### Scenario Context

### Hooks 
environement.py
+-- features/  
|     +-- steps/  
|     |    +-- website_steps.py  
|     |    +-- utils.py  
|     |   
|     +-- environment.py      # -- Environment controls(code to run before and after steps, scenarios, features or the whole shooting match)  
|     +-- signup.feature  
|     +-- login.feature

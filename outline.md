# BDD
## What is behavior?
In software it describes how the software operates  

I had a problem. While using and teaching agile practices like test-driven development (TDD) on projects in
different environments, I kept coming across the same confusion and misunderstandings. Programmers wanted
to know where to start, what to test and what not to test, how much to test in one go, what to call their
tests, and how to understand why a test fails.  
[_Dan North_](https://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/)

Where does TDD fall short:
* In TDD process developers want to know what to test, how much to test, and how to understand failing tests
* Whiteout clear guidelines as to what should be tested and how confusion and misunderstanding are common
* Presenting in a different light through BDD allow the development process to avoid a number of pitfails

### It answers WHAT more than HOW
Behavior are defined early in development using specification by example: plain-language descriptions (Gherkin) that tell what more than how
Behavior specs becomes requirements, ACC and acceptance tests (all in one)  

BDD emphasizes the client's perspective  

## What is BDD?
BDD is a second-generation, outsideâ€“in, pull-based, multiple-stakeholder, multiple-scale, high-automation, 
agile methodology. It describes a cycle of interactions with well-defined outputs, resulting in the delivery 
of working, tested software that matters. 

_Dan North_ 

## Benefits of BDD

The Big BDD picture: The main goals of BDD are collaboration and automation

* Allows everybody involved to write tests not just coders
* Supports collaboration - behviors testing allows you to test your application as a whole in such a way that all
stakeholders can define and understand what is being test
* Supports automation
* Behavior are identified using specification by example
* Encourage thinking about the application in a natural consistent language
* Behavior specs becomes requirements, ACC and acceptance tests (all in one)
* BDD is a refinement of Agile process, not an overhoul - formalizes ACC and test coverage

# Behave Test Framework
## Installation check

Pre-training preparation - [behave_workshop/installation.md](installation.md)

## Feature Files

Feature files has a natural language format - describing a feature or part of a feature with representative examples of
expected outcomes

### Gherkin mechanics
Given, when, then (and, but) - forms the actual steps. Those map to python step implementation.

<span style="color: red;">**Feature**</span>: feature name  

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: blue;">**Scenario**</span>: some scenario   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">**Given**</span> some condition <span style="color: grey;">#put the system in a known state</span>   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">**When**</span> some action taken <span style="color: grey;">#we take key action the user or external system performs</span>   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: green;">**Then**</span> some result is expected. <span style="color: grey;">#we observe outcomes</span>   


You may also include "And" or "But" as a step - those are renamed by behave to take the name of their preceding step
### Writing a scenario

Behave operates on paths
1. features - with feature files written by your business analyst / sponsor / product owner / whoever 
with your behavior scenarios
2. steps - with python step implementation for the scenarios

Steps:  
1. Create a `features` directory in your project path  
2. In `features` directory create a file `google.feature`  
![alt text](./img/featurefiles.png "First feature file")
3. Write your first scenario  
![alt text](./img/googlesearchfeature.PNG "Google search feature")  
4. Run it with `behave` command
5. Go further to fix it ;)

## Steps

Steps used in the scenarios are implemented in Python files in the `steps` directory.
You call the files whatever you like as long as they use the `.py` extension. You don't need to tell behave which ones to
use - it will use all of them.

### Step file creation

Step definition - a python function decorated by a matching string in a step definition module.  
Given, When, Then steps are "glued" to a step definitions with decorators.  

Steps are identified using decorators which match the predicate from the feature file: given, when, then, step.  
The decorators accepts a string containing the rest of the phrase used in the scenario step.  

1. Create a `steps` directory in `features` path  
2. In `steps` directory create a file `googlesearch.py`  
![alt text](./img/stepsdefinitions.png "steps dir")  
3. Run it with `behave` - behave prints all missing steps as `step_impl`
The function names do not need to have a unique symbol name. The text matching selects the step function from the step 
registry before it is called as anonymous function.  
Anonymous function - function definition that is not bound to an identifier. Anonymous functions are often arguments being
passed to highest order functions.  
![alt text](./img/stepimpl.PNG "steps identifier")  
4. Correct our feature file to serach for something meaningful  
![alt text](./img/searchbehave.PNG "search behave python")  
5. Run precheck to check if behave can find our steps definitions: `behave --dry-run`  
![alt text](./img/dryrun.PNG "dryrun")  
6. Make it work  

7. Run your code with verbose option `behave -v` to check if you want to see what behave is doing in attempting to find your features
